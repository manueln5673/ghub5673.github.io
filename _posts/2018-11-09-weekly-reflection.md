  This week in Computer science we worked on understanding functions using contracts and function definitions and design recipe again to understand how fuctions work and how to work with them. Contracts are made by people to tell them what to expect from writing a function into a computer basically show them what they're actions cause. We also practiced function definitions and how to make it easier to make a function without making a fuction. Let me explain, last week I talked about the design recipe well to understand functions this week we used design recipe again. Design recipe is basically making it easier for you to create an image without having to write a function down multiple times.
