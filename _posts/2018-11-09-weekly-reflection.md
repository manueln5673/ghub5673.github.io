  This week in Computer science we worked on understanding functions using contracts and function definitions and design recipe again to understand how fuctions work and how to work with them. Contracts are made by people to tell them what to expect from writing a function into a computer basically show them what they're actions cause. We also practiced function definitions and how to make it easier to make a function without making a fuction. Let me explain, last week I talked about the design recipe well to understand functions this week we used design recipe again. Design recipe is basically making it easier for you to create an image without having to write a function down multiple times. You would first have to create a contract to show you what to expect from what you are about to do, next you create two examples of the contract as functions so writing regular functions that show the image you would like to make. Finnaly,you have to define the function but you have to use variables for one value for us it was the value for the size of the image so now we could simply write (gt 20) instead of having to write out a whole function just to change the size of the green triangle.
