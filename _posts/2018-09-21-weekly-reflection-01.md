  This class so far has been very interesting and I have enjoyed the past I want to say two weeks. Anyways, I personally enjoy the class I mean we have made our own website and school just started so if this is what the rest of the two years we have here look like im excited to see what we do next. So far I have leard that .html is the basic structure of a website, the web is completely made out of different documents, and that css is the way something looks. The class isn't very challenging now but when we have to start programming these websites without the help of a google document the teacher writes this class will get very challenging for the entire class.
