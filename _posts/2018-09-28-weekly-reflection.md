   It is nearly october now and the class used to be an odd class to me it wasn't really interesting but after everything we have been discussing I have more and more interested in this class and now I have a lot of fun in it. We have beem learning about coordinates using a white board to help visualize coordinates, and we are learning about coordinates because the plan is to make our own game that is like the game we played with the ninja cat. The plan is to help us learn about changes games make with their programming like the change in score or the cats movement. So far I have learned that the x coordinate is where your character moves from right to left and the y coordinate is the character moving up and down both will play a big role in moving the character you to well make move.
