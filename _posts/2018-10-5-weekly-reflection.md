This week in Intro to Computer science we learned a lot about the coding of a computer. We used contracts as a way to basically talk to the computer although with even one mistake in that language and the computer will not understand you at all. An example of a proper contract for an image might be ;square:Number String String and that would produce an image of a square. However if you do it incorrectly for example (star 50 "solid" "red") is a correct version of a contract but if you switch solid and red the computer wont recognize it and wont accept, and the computer will then tell you what is wrong so you may fix the problem. I wasnt here on Friday unfortunately but I heard that we had started a project that I am very excited to start working on, this week we also learned about different names in html like <head> which represents the header of the document. Next week we will probably dive deeper into contracts and essentaily talking to a computer to get it to do what we want it to.
