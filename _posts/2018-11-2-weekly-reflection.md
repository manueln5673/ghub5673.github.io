This week in Computer science we worked on wescheme and on pen and paper to try design recipe and more expresions and contracts to make it easier for us to use to create specific images. I dont't think I said that the best way I could but let me explain, in wescheme we used design recipe, and the steps for design recipe are step 1:create contract step 2:create examples and step 3 :Define. Okay now you know the steps let me explain create a contract for the image you would like to make then create examples of the images you would like to make finnaly, the final step is to define the value you will use when creating these images so you can use that name and just change the size whenever you want to change the size of the specific image you are making. I used a triangle amd now if I use the name gt and add a size value a triangle will come up and I can adjust the size whenever I want. This week we also worked on expressions and their relation to contracts which ended on us finding out what a contract really is. Anyways we were matching expressions to their contract and we had to use the contracts to expect what the expresion would be from the contact. Mr Allata then asked us what a contract is I drew a blank but someone had gotten the answer a contract tells the programmer what to expect, the contract is basically like for lack of a better term warning sign telling you what to expect from what's ahead.
