This week in Intro to Computer science we used wescheme a website which allows us to code using cintracts and making images like squares and circles from the contracts. Unfortunately I wasn't here on tuesday so I don't really know what happened then however I can elaborate on what we did using wescheme. When we were using wescheme we had the task of making the image of a red circle inside of a blue square and having that red circle go to the bottom right corner. The circles where the basically coordinates were for the circle and sqaure and color had to be modiefied to move the images. This proccess reminded me of a guess and check becuase I personally checked where the circle went when I changed the coordinates to make another educated guess in the right direction. I have checked my jumprope and saw that I have a 2.2 in the class so I need help in many things but I will focus on one for now. I need support in predicting the output of a program by evaluating expressions and by tracing a reactive system.
