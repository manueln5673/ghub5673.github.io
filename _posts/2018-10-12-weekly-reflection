This week in Intro to Computer science we used wescheme a website which allows us to code using cintracts and making images like squares and circles from the contracts. Unfortunately I wasn't here on tuesday so I don't really know what happened then however I can elaborate on what we did using wescheme. When we were using wescheme we had the task of making the image of a red circle inside of a blue square and having that red circle go to the bottom right corner. The circles where the basically coordinates were for the circle and sqaure and color had to be modiefied to move the images.
