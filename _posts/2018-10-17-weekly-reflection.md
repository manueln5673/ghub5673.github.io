  This week in Intro to Computer Science we did more on wescheme we were tasked to make a national flag so that we learned hoe to better use the contracts we had to make objects like circles, squares etc. Creating the flag was the hard part we had to make the coordinates fit for where we wanted a piece to go and had to adjust the size of the various shapes like a rectangle if you were making the mexican flag each rectangle needed had to be a different color and in different areas of the space. Myself I chose to do the Japanese Flag it was probably the easiest flag to do but again it was still dificult at least for me. First I had to make a decently small circle red, I toyed around with the size and finnaly found the perfect size, but I still had to find the right coordinates for the circle once that was done all that was left was the outline essentialy the flag itself. In the end I didn't use a color for the flag but instead used a black outline to seem like it was the flag and I managed to complete the flag. There still were problems tho the rectangle itself was too thin and too wide so I had the change the way the rectangle works entirely finnaly getting it the way I wanted.
