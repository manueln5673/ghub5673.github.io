  #My Flag
  This week in computer science we did another Flag Project however this was much more difficult than the first one because it had to be geometrically accurate. I chose to try and complete the Pakistan Flag which at first didnt seem to be to dificult but was actually much more complicated than I though it was. The flag itself was a green square, a white rectangle, a crecent, and a star. The ratio for the entire flag was 3 to 2 with 3 being the width and 2 being the hoist of the flag, both the white rectangle and green square had different measurements inside the flag so I had to be careful with not messing those measurements up along with the measurements of the actual flag. The star and crecent also had different measurements however I was really confused on how to actually get those two shapes and their missurements onto the flag I had made. 
 # Questions and Challenges
  One question asked this week was how can we turn one huge complicated problem into multiple simple problems that could be solved more esily than the complicated question could. For example the crecent in my flag it can be helpful to make a circle that has a radius that connects to the crecent making it easier to make the measurements of the crecent put that on the flag. Like I said the main ratio for the flag was 3 to 2 which is what I made the measurements of my actual flag but I soon figuered out that those measurements were way to small so that is a mistake I made next time I will make the measurements as a ratio that can fit into the ratio of 3 to 2.
