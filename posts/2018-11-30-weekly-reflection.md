  What is the value of the third argument of the innermost function in the expression below? Accoriding to the porportion correct 50% of everyone who took the test got this question wrong and how do you solve this problem? This question was part of mastery skill 1 "Use tools" meaning understanding everything like contracts and interpreting questions, and this was also a novice level question for that mastery skill. The answer was blue as the expression was scale(2,circle(40,"solid", "blue")) the anwer was blue because it was the third argument in the expression. Scale being there confused a lot of people and which is why the second most chosen answer was C because people counted scale as an argument instead of as a function making people choose the wrong answer of C. The question also states it must be the 3rd argument of the innermost functon the innermost function is circle and 40 solid and blue are the arguments making blue the 3rd argument in the innermost function.
